Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:934 - Output port "ce_out" connected to sig "tmp_ce_out" on
   Partition "/top/RECONFIG_PART" is not connected.  To fix this problem, either
   remove the output port from the appropriate input source file or make sure
   the port is connected to logic outside the Partition.
WARNING:MapLib:1235 - The undriven or constant signals indicate that further
   logic reduction is possible if the Partition "/top/RECONFIG_PART" is removed.

Phase 7.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement
WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <EOC_A> is placed at site <E13>. The
   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK
   if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is normally an ERROR
   but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <EOC_A_BUFGP/EOC_A.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
