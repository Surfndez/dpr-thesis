WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (20.000000)
   was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM "DCM_ADV_INST".  This does
   not match the PERIOD constraint value (100 MHz.).  The uncertainty
   calculation will use the non-default attribute value.  This could result in
   incorrect uncertainty calculated for DCM output clocks.

   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK

   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the

  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.
