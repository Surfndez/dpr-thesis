WARNING:NgdBuild:1023 - Could not resolve reconfigurable Partition block
   'RECONFIG_PART'.  This may be legal if you are implementing the Partition as
   a blackbox.   If it is not a blackbox, you should check that the Partition's
   module file, 'controller.ngc'  or 'controller.edf' (or another valid EDIF
   extension), exists and is properly set up in a search path (see the -sd
   option).

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (20.000000)

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing

is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.
