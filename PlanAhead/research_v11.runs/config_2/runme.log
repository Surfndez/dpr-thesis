WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (20.000000)
   was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM "DCM_ADV_INST".  This does
   not match the PERIOD constraint value (100 MHz.).  The uncertainty
   calculation will use the non-default attribute value.  This could result in
   incorrect uncertainty calculated for DCM output clocks.

WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal

   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK

   <EOC_A_BUFGP/EOC_A.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing

is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.
