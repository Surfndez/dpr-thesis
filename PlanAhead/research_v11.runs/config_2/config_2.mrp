  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:934 - Output port "ce_out" connected to sig "tmp_ce_out" on
   Partition "/top/RECONFIG_PART" is not connected.  To fix this problem, either
   remove the output port from the appropriate input source file or make sure
   the port is connected to logic outside the Partition.
WARNING:MapLib:1235 - The undriven or constant signals indicate that further
   logic reduction is possible if the Partition "/top/RECONFIG_PART" is removed.
WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <EOC_A> is placed at site <E13>. The
   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK
   if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is normally an ERROR
   but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <EOC_A_BUFGP/EOC_A.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CONFIG_STATE/cfg_not0001 is

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  30 block(s) optimized away
 739 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
