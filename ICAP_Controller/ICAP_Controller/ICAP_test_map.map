  Number of Slice LUTs:                         27 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       26 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              12
      Number using O5 output only:              13
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        14
    Number using O6 output only:                14

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    13 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           29
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             8 out of      29   27%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of      29    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          19 out of      29   65%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
